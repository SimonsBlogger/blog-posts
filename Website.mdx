# How to make a Website

## What is a Website

Before we can begin to actually build a website, we need to define what a website is and how it works.

A website is a collection of related web pages (html files).
Web pages contain html code (structure define language) which defines how a website is structured.
It also can contain Javascript files which are used to handle data on the client 
and the least is css which containes the styling of the website.

## Server and Client side Rendering

Once the page is structured and styled on the server, it get's send to the pc who requested the page.
Back in the time, this was the only way websites existed and this is called static sites.
Now we also have access to Javascript which offer to rerender the page on the client without always have to load a new page.

You can also build a complete webite whithout javascript but this is not the modern approach.

## How to actually make one

Making a Website is very easy, you just need a texteditor, write html code and save that file as [filename].html
then you open it with your browser and there you have your own website.

here is an example of javascript code:
```tsx
    function test (){
        console.log("hello world");
    }
```
